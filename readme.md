# AFNM Mod - Stabilizers Drop From Raids

## Quick Overview

A barebones AFNM mod to add pillar stabilization items as valid drops to Fallen Star raids.

## Why?

It is absurd that raiding Fallen Stars can make you functionally immortal and give you infinite rare pillar components to sell for cash, but the only way to get Pillar stabilization componenets is to gamble on uncut jade once a month and pray to RNGesus. 

## Specifics

This mod adds Pillar Stabilizers and Soul Reinforcers to the reward pool for all existing and future Fallen Star raid events. The reward distribution logic is not modified, so higher tier Raids still result in more total items and more opportunities to get specific components. 

Life Foundations have not been added and remain a crafting-only option.
